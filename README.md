# Routing-Loop-and-Split-Horizon
The code implements the routing loop condition and its prevention mechanism which is split horizon.
Split horizon is a method of preventing a routing loop in a network. 
The basic principle is simple: Information about the routing for a particular packet is never sent back in the direction
from which it was received.
